# Code in the open

## Measure

* All source code, policy and software, used by the codebase that is not used for fraud detection MUST be published and publicly accessible.
* Any source code that is not currently in use, such as new versions, proposals or older versions SHOULD be published. 
* Contributors MUST never upload sensitive information regarding users, the organization or third parties to the repository, for example: configurations, usernames and passwords, public keys and other real credentials used in the production system.
* The source code MAY provide the general public insight into which source code underpins any specific interaction they have with your organization.

## What this does

* Transparency
* Better quality code
* Auditability

## What this doesnâ€™t do

* Make things reusable
* Make the codebase and the code inside it understandable to everyone

## How to test

* The current version of the source is published on the internet where it can be seen from outside the original contributing organization and without the need for any form of authentication

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policies in the open
* Prioritise open and transparent in policies

## Management: what you need to do

* Develop a culture that embraces openness, learning and feedback
* Collaborate with external vendors and freelancers through working in the open

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Clearly split data and code: never upload sensitive information regarding users, the organization or third parties to the repository, for example: configurations, usernames and passwords, public keys and other real credentials used in the production system
